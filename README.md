# External server submission type

## Installation

Place in /mod/assign/submission/

## Configuration

As an administrator you can set the default values instance-wide on the settings page for
administrators in the extserver module, as well as manage and test the available external servers.

## Description

The external server submission type enables users to submit files to be processed automatically by an external server.

The activity module stores the submitted files and sends it via curl to the chosen server. This server is used to process the files in an automated way (e.g. automatically compile and run a certain source code) and is able to return an automatically calculated grade and feedback afterwards.

Please note that in order for the external server to write back feedback comments, the "Feedback comments" feedback type has to be enabled for the assignment, as this plugin provides no separate feedback column.

### Usage Example

Students of a computer science course have to write code to fullfill a certain task. The source code has to be submitted via this activity until a (optional) certain deadline. As soon as the students submit their version of the solution, the files get transfered to the external server and are automatically compiled and tested. Based on the output of the compiler, the testing framework and
similar criteria the server calculates the grade and prepares an automated feedback for the students.

After everyone has submitted their solution (or the deadline passed) and all the processing is done, the teacher grades the students simply by fetching the grades from the external server. Afterwards the teacher is able to overrule the automatic grading or grade everyone manually from the start.

## Documentation / Interface description

Server-side code is included in this plugin under /tests/demo.

If you want to use this exact code for testing purposes, just chown wwwdata for the /upload directory, so you can upload files.

### Connection check:

GET request to the URL set in the server settings.

Without any variables - just to check HTTP Status Code.

### Teacher View:

GET request to the URL set in the server settings.

with following variables:

    timestamp     = Time of request
    user          = Teacher's username
    skey          = Teacher's sesskey
    uidnr         = Teacher's idnumber
    action        = 'view';
    cidnr         = Moodle DB id number for the course
    aid           = UNIX timestamp when the external server module has been created in the course
    aname         = External Server Module's name
    fname         = Teacher's first name
    lname         = Teacher's last name
    role          = 'teacher'
    studusername  = Student's user name (usually = '')
    akey          = Accesskey calculated from server secret, timestamp, current users username, moodle sesskey,
                    user's idnumber, action, course id, creation timestamp of extserver, name of extserver module,
                    firstname, lastname, role and student's username
    groupinfo     = (optional) JSON-encoded array of objects containing ID, name and members (=array of usernames)
    groupinfohash = (optional) hashed JSON encoded groupinfo with prepended server secret
